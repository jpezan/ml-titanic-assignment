# Supervised Learning Titanic Assignment
Supervised Learning: Predict if a passenger survived or not aboard the Titanic

## Submission:
- Submit a .html file with the code. Do not submit python notebooks
- Make your code easily readable and interactive for an outside user
- Explain your thought process at each step 

## Dataset:
Titanic

## Problem
- Problem type: Supervised Learning 
- Predict if a passenger survived or not. Use “Survived” column as your target variable
- You can use the remaining columns as your feature set. Feel free to not include any 
columns if you don’t think it provides value for your model

## Instructions to get full credit:
- Understand the problem (2-3 lines)
- Check the completeness of the data
- Show any data cleaning that needs to be done prior to analysis
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Train-Test split (Feel free to choose the split)
- Apply 3 supervised learning algorithms (You can apply more if you’re not satisfied with 
results)
- Make sure you standardize the features before fitting the models
- Calculate 3 metrics to evaluate each of the classification algorithms
- Which is your best performing model. Explain
- Approach for deploying the model into production (Theoretical)
